Your GitHub READMEs should have at least a "General information" section, a "Data and file overview" section, and a "Rendered output" section in your README for full credit.  

Note that the "Data and file overview" section does not have to look exactly like the one in this repo; it can be a list of folders and files that you write out. See [this repository](https://github.com/an-bui/new-repository) as an example.
