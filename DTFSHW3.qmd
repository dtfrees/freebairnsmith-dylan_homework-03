```

```{r}
str(drought_exp)
class(drought_exp)
```

**Clean the data**

```{r}
# cleaning
drought_exp_clean <- drought_exp %>% 
  clean_names() %>% # nicer column names
  mutate(species_name = case_when( # adding column with species scientific names
    species == "ENCCAL" ~ "Encelia californica", # bush sunflower
    species == "ESCCAL" ~ "Eschscholzia californica", # California poppy

  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) # getting rid of gridlines
```

Choose 3 pairs of variables to compare. Make notes of those comparisons below.

**Root and Shoot mass are strongly positively correlated (pearson's r: 0.553)**

**Root and total mass strongly positively correlated (pearson's r: 0.858)**

**Root and total mass are strongly positively correlated (pearson's r: 0.902)**

### How does total biomass differ between species?

```{r}
ggplot(data = drought_exp_clean, # data frame
       aes(x = reorder(species_name, # reordering x-axis
                       -total_g, # in reverse(descending) order of mean total biomass
                       fun = mean), # calculating mean to reorder
           y = total_g)) + # y-axis
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, # narrow jitter
              height = 0) # not jittering points up and down
```

**Plants with larger biomass seem to have larger ranges. Grindelia has highest biomass and Acmispon has the lowest.**

### How does total biomass differ between water treatments?

```{r}
ggplot(data = drought_exp_clean, # data frame
       aes(x = water_treatment, # x-axis
           y = total_g)) + # y-axis
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, # narrow jitter
              height = 0) # not jittering points up and down
```

**Well watered plants have a much larger range of total biomass than drought stressed plants. Overall, the well watered plants have a larger biomass. This makes sense based on the biology of plants**

### how does specific leaf area (SLA) influence total biomass?

```{r}
ggplot(data = drought_exp_clean, # data frame
       aes(x = sla, # x-axis
           y = total_g)) + # y-axis
  geom_point() # scatterplot
```

**Specific leaf area seems to have not much effect on the total biomass. However, statistically they have a moderate correlation (Check correlation!).**

# Model construction

What is the null model?

0.  **None of the factors can predict the other.**

What is the saturated model?

1.  **SLA, Water treatment, and species.**

In class we are going to try two more models:

2.  **Total biomass as a function of SLA and water treatment.**
3.  **Total biomass as a function of SLA and species.**

For homework, you will construct one more model:

4.  **Total biomass as a function of water treatment and species.**

You will then compare all 5 models to determine which best describes total biomass. **For your homework, you will need to create a table summarizing the structure of these models.**

## 0. Null model

```{r}
model0 <- lm(total_g ~ 1, # formula
             data = drought_exp_clean) # data frame
```

## 1. total biomass as a function of SLA, water treatment, and species

```{r}
# saturated model
model1 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + water_treatment + species_name,
             data = drought_exp_clean)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(model1)
# you might get a warning when you run this code - that is ok!
```

**diagnostic for saturated model looked good**

## 2. total biomass as a function of SLA and water treatment

```{r}
model2 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + water_treatment,
             data = drought_exp_clean)

plot(model2)
```

**Look at diagnostics later**

## 3. total biomass as a function of SLA and species

```{r}
model3 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + species_name,
             data = drought_exp_clean)

plot(model3)
```

**Look at diagnostics later**

```{r}
model4 <- lm(total_g ~ water_treatment + species_name,
             data = drought_exp_clean)

plot(model4)
```

# Model selection

From the `MuMIn` package

Multi Model Inference (MuMIn)

```{r}
model.sel(model0,
          model1, 
          model2, 
          model3,
          model4)
```

Out of the four models we have tried, the best model is the one that includes **Only two of three predictors: Species and water treatment.** (Lowest AIC)

***Note that this may change once you fit and compare the other model!***

**look at the diagnostic again**

# Model summaries

```{r}
summary(model0)
```

```{r}
summary(model1)
```

```{r}
summary(model2)
```

```{r}
summary(model3)
```

```{r}
summary(model4)
```

What are the reference levels?

summary(model1) - reference for `species_name`

**reference for water_treatment:** water_treatment: Drought stressed **reference for species_name:** Species_Name: Acispon Glaber

Interpret the model estimates for the:

-   intercept: **Mass of Acmispon Glaber in drought stressed treatment when SLA = 0**\
-   SLA slope: **Across drought treatments and species, with each 1 unit increase in SLA (mm^2^/dry mass leaf), we expect an increase in total mass of - 0.00025 WHICH MEANS WITH THE ESTIMATE AND STANDARD ERROR THERE IS NO EFFECT OF SLA ON TOTAL MASS**\
-   well watered estimate: **Across species and SLA well watered plants tend to be 0.12 ± 0.02 grams heavier than drought stressed plants**\
-   Lotus scoparius (Acmispon Glaber) estimate: **When in a drought stressed treatment and when SLA = 0 Lotus Scoparius has 0.08 ± 0.06 grams of biomass.** \<-- ***???***{.underline}
-   Stipa(Nasella) pulchra estimate: **Across water treatments and SLA *Stipa pulchra* tend to be 0.24 ± 0.04 grams heavier than Acmispon Glaber**

## Problem 1

### a. Table

```{r}
#| output: FALSE
# Create a manual tibble to add the AIC delta to the table
rows <- tribble(
  ~term, ~null, ~"model 1", ~"model 2", ~"model 3", ~"model 4",
  'AIC ∆', '81.22','2.44',  '60.37','32.12', '0.00'
)
attr(rows, 'position') <- c(20) # put the new row in the 20th row of the table

# Comparing models
modelsummary <- modelsummary::modelsummary( # this function takes a list of models
  list( 
    "Null" = model0, # "model name" = model object
    "Model 1" = model1,
    "Model 2" = model2,
    "Model 3" = model3,
    "Model 4" = model4
  ),
  add_rows = rows, # add the manually made tibble to the table
  gof_map = c("r.squared", "aic"), # only include the r squared and aic in the goodness of fit stats
  title = "Table 1: Linear Regression of Effect of SLA, Water Treatment, and Various Plant Species on Total Biomass", # add a title
  statistic = c("p = {p.value}"), # make only p-value statistics added to the table
  output = "flextable", # make the output table a flextable so it can be edited as one
  stars = TRUE # add stars to statistically significant values
)

# Customize the flextable
modelsummary <- modelsummary %>% 
  autofit() %>% # make the spacing of the columns reasonable
  border_inner_v() %>% # make vertical lines in between the cells
  border_inner_h() %>% # make horizontal lines in between the cells
  bg(i = c(1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19:21), bg = "grey") %>% # make the background of certain rows grey
  bold(part = "header") # make the headers of the columns bold

# it would not add a title w/o this explicit separate addition
modelsummary <- flextable::set_caption(modelsummary, 
                                       caption = "Table 1: Linear Model of Effect of SLA, Water Treatment, and Various Plant Species on Total Biomass")
```

Table 1: The columns are defined by the different and each row shows a differnet predictor variable estimate and the p-value ($\alpha = 0.05$) below it. The Null model has none of the predictor values. The saturated model with all predictor variables is Model 1 (F(8, 61) = 23.44, p-val \< 0.001, $\alpha = 0.05$, $R^2 = 0.7545$). Model 2 (F(2, 67) = 14.57, p-val \< 0.001, $\alpha = 0.05$, $R^2 = 0.3031$), Model 3 (F(7, 62) = 13.85, p-val \< 0.001, $\alpha = 0.05$, $R^2 = 0.61$), and Model 4 (F(7, 62) = 27.08, p-val \< 0.001, $\alpha = 0.05$, $R^2 = 0.7535$) each have some other combination of Specific Leaf Area (sla), Water-treatment, and Species Type.

```{r}
modelsummary
```

### b. Write a 5-6 sentence “statistical methods” section.

To analyze the influence of Specific Leaf Area (SLA), Species Type, and water treatment on total biomass of plant roots and shoots. We used five different linear regression models. These included a null model with no predictors (**model 0**)(, a saturated model with all three predictors (**model 1**),a model with SLA and water treatment (**model 2**), a model with SLA and Species Type (**model 3**), and a model with water treatment and Species Type (**model 4**). To choose the final model that best predicts the total biomass and is the least complex, we used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). **Model 4** (water treatment and Species Type) had the lowest AIC (-159.2) and was therefore the best model to use. I then plotted and analyzed the diagnostics of **Model 4**, where I visually assessed that the residuals were homoscedastic, normally distributed and outliers were not an issue.

### c. Visualization

#### Model predictions

model_preds <- ggpredict(model4, 
                         terms = c(
                                   "water_treatment", 
                                   "species_name"))

  summarise(mean_sp_dif = mean(predicted),
            mean_sp_se = mean(std.error))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### e. Write a 3-4 sentence results section.

Model 4 with predictors Species type and water treatment had the best prediction of the total biomass. (F(7, 62) = 27.08, p-val \< 0.001, $\alpha = 0.05$, $R^2 = 0.7535$) (AIC = -159.2). On average, the total biomass of Well watered plants were 0.117 ± 0.017g heavier than drought treated plants (p \< 0.001). On average, the total biomass across species was 0.279 ± 0.025g heavier than drought-treated Acmispon glaber plants (all p \< 0.001 except for Penstemon centranthifolius).

## **Problem 2**

### a.

I have a number of different predictor variables that I was looking at to see if they influenced my plunge time. I think I want to look at how the air temp and weather type affected my plunge time. I am thinking of doing a thermometer with temps labelled on one side and then symbols representing different time spent plunging classifications and then something to add to those symbols to represent weather type. These symbols will stack horizontally to from left to right.

### b. **Inital Affective Data Viz**

### c. **Draft Affective Data Viz**

![Draft](images/IMG_0947.jpg){fig-align="center" width="2016"}

### d.

In this piece I am showing how my time spent cold plunging varies over different air temps and weather types. Each circle represents one cold plunge and hwo filled in it is represents the amount of time spent in the water during that cold plunge. I drew a lot of inspiration from [Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupi’s Dear Data project](https://www.dear-data.com/all). This is just an initial pencil skecth but I will put colors into this sketch to make the piece more attractive. I spent a lot of time brain storming which variables to use and how to use them.

\##**Problem 3** https://doi.org/10.1006/jmsc.2000.0808

###a. Revisit and Summarize The authors used Principal Component Analysis (PCA), 

One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and a Pearson product-moment correlation matrix. The PCA was used to explore site and species relationships. The ANOVA was used to see the significance of each variable that had an influence on the clustering of the sites and species. Finally, the correlation matrix was used to find relationships between abiotic variables.

![Source: Tuya et al., 2000](images/stat_crit.png)

###b. Visual Clarity

I think the authors did a good job representing their One-Way ANOVA statistics clearly relative to the complexity of their analyses.  The x and y axis are in a logical position; however I think they could have had less intervals on the y-axis because it is not very clear on the units of density and I think what matters much more is to show if the density are relatively higher or lower.  They did not do a great job showing underlying data or summary statistics. The bar-and-whisker plot leaves out any underlying data and does not show the low end of the SE or CI whisker (it did not specify what the whisker represented).

###c. Aesthetic clarity

I think that the authors had a balanced data:ink ratio; none of the ink was pointless. The only extraneous info that I would have taken out would have been to thin the intervals on the y-axis. There are the borders around the plots and the filled in bars which are extra ink, but I think that they are useful in differentiating the space and showing which statistics were significant and which one weren't.  To lessen the amount of ink on the page they could possibly use hatching instead of a complete fill on the bars.

###d. Recommendations

My first recommendation would be to create fewer intervals on the y-axis because I don't think the main message of the figure is enhanced at all by more specificity of the density of the urchins.  My second recommendation would be to add the underlying data of the different urchin densities across sites and sizes.  I would do this by adding a jitter plot of these points faceted and grouped in the same way the bars are.  I would also keep the current coloring by having the small urchin data points a different color than the other ones, but put the coloring on on the jittered points. If they did not want jittered points I would recommend to hatch the bars instead of filling them to help the data:ink ratio. Finally, I would also add a mean point and 95% Confidence Interval error bar in place of the bar-and-whisker, this would show the underlying data and the low end of the CI.

What recommendations would you make to make the figure better? What would you take out, add, or change? Provide explanations/justifications for each of your recommendations.

Alternatively, if they did not represent their statistics in a figure, what kind of figure would you recommend to them? Describe the x- and y-axes, with any geometries and aesthetics (colors, etc.). Provide enough explanation such that someone would be able to create the figure you describe in code. Provide explanations/justifications for the figure you would recommend.
